/// Interface to ØMQ socket objects.
///
/// # Key differences to conventional sockets
///
/// Generally speaking, conventional sockets present a *synchronous* interface to either
/// connection-oriented reliable byte streams (`SOCK_STREAM`), or connection-less unreliable
/// datagrams (`SOCK_DGRAM`). In comparison, ØMQ sockets present an abstraction of an asynchronous
/// *message queue*, with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use. Where
/// conventional sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, ØMQ sockets transfer
/// discrete *messages*.
///
/// ØMQ sockets being *asynchronous* means that the timings of the physical connection setup and
/// tear down, reconnect and effective delivery are transparent to the user and organized by ØMQ
/// itself. Further, messages may be *queued* in the event that a peer is unavailable to receive
/// them.
///
/// Conventional sockets allow only strict one-to-one (two peers), many-to-one (many clients, one
/// server), or in some cases one-to-many (multicast) relationships. With the exception of
/// *`zeromq::PAIR`*, ØMQ sockets may be connected **to multiple endpoints** using *`connect()`*,
/// while simultaneously accepting incoming connections **from multiple endpoints** bound to the
/// socket using *`bind()`*, thus allowing many-to-many relationships.
pub trait ZmqSocket {

    fn getsockopt(&self, option: consts::SocketOption) -> int;

    /// This function binds the *socket* to a local endpoint and then accepts incoming connections
    /// on that endpoint.
    ///
    /// The *`endpoint`* is a string consisting of a *`transport://`* followed by an *`address`*.
    /// The *`transport`* specifies the underlying protocol to use. The *`address`* specifies the
    /// transport-specific address to bind to.
    ///
    /// ØMQ provides the the following transports:
    ///
    /// > ***`tcp`***
    /// >> unicast transport using TCP
    ///
    /// > ***`inproc`***
    /// >> local in-process (inter-task) communication transport
    ///
    /// Every ØMQ socket type except *`zeromq::PAIR`* supports one-to-many and many-to-one
    /// semantics.

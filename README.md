# zmq.rs - native stack of ØMQ in Rust

zmq.rs is a native implementation of ØMQ in the [Rust programming language][1]. It is still in a
very early stage of designing and development, so it is **not** supposed to be used seriously now.

If you are looking for the libzmq wrapper in Rust, it is [rust-zmq](https://github.com/erickt/rust-zmq).

## Ownership and License

The contributors are listed in AUTHORS. This project uses the MPL v2 license, see LICENSE.

zmq.rs uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)][2] process for contributions.

zmq.rs uses [this style guide][3] found on Rust wiki for code style.

To report an issue, use the [zmq.rs issue tracker][4] at github.com.

## Usage

There are only very few interfaces implemented till now. Try this example as `src/hello-zmq.rs`:

```rust
extern crate zeromq;

fn main() {
    let ctx = zeromq::Context::new();

    let mut req = ctx.socket(zeromq::REQ);
    req.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:12347").unwrap();

    let mut rep = ctx.socket(zeromq::REP);
    rep.bind("tcp://127.0.0.1:12347").unwrap();

    let mut msg = box zeromq::Msg::new(4);
    msg.data.push_all([65u8, 66u8, 67u8, 68u8]);

    req.msg_send(msg).unwrap();
    println!("We got: {}", rep.msg_recv().unwrap());
}
```

We recommend using [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) to build this program. Create a file
`Cargo.toml` with:

```toml
[package]

name = "hello-zmq"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["you@example.com"]

[[bin]]

name = "hello-zmq"

[dependencies.zeromq]

git = "https://github.com/zeromq/zmq.rs.git"
```

Then build and run with cargo, who will automatically download and build the dependencies for you:

```bash
$ cargo build
$ ./target/hello-zmq
```

## Documentation

API document can be found [here](http://www.rust-ci.org/zeromq/zmq.rs/doc/zmq/), and there are tons
of useful documentation at [zeromq.org](http://zeromq.org/intro:read-the-manual).

## Development

Under C4.1 process, you are more than welcome to help us by:

* join the discussion over anything from design to code style
* try out and submit issue reports or feature requests
* **pick a task and get it done** - there are plenty of them in the issues page
* fork the repository and have your own fixes
* send us pull requests
* and even star this project `^_^`

To run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```
